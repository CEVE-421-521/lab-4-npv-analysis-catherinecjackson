Using information from Zillow and HAR, I was able to find information about the value of the home itself and the square footage of the property.  The home is valued at $264,456 and has a square footage of 881 square feet.  However, this is made complicated by the fact that floods only damage **structures** and not the land itself.  For this reason, I found nearby lots, without homes or structures, and analyzed their values.  Based on this analysis, I found that a similar location, close to the water and heart of Galveston, could go for anywhere around $70,000.  This leaves a structural value of $194,456.\n"

        "This graph plots, with each elevation as a line, the expected costs as T goes from 0 to 30.  For the first line, the expected damages start very small, as there is no elevation cost the first year, but they grow quickly as the home is vulnerable to flooding every single year.  As the house is elevated, the slope of this line decreases as the vulnerability each year declines.  Eventually, the line becomes almost flat as the intercept is determined by the elevation cost and there is relatively no year to year vulnerability.\n",

This is a wise parameter in which we can consider uncertainty as it is a very hypothetical representation of the fact that people tend to value money in the present more than in the future.  It is a very subjective estimation, and considering this uncertainty is important.\n",
